# Screen Exhibition

Hey, dude, how is it going ;) Remember we were talking about our own business? The time has come! I’ve found “investors”
who sponsored some tv, so we can sell them. Though we can’t afford that, but I want that tv array so bad to capture our
potential customers. I think it would be nice just to make it virtual and show on a big screen.

## Acceptance criteria:

- Tv array should be present (3 x 4)
- Should exist buttons: “On”, “Off” and “Sync”
- Clicking “On” should turn on all dead tv
- Clicking “Off” should turn off all working tv
- Clicking “Sync” should synchronise all working tv
- Clicking a single tv should turn it on/off
- When clicking a single tv it shouldn’t sync all working tv

## Example:

### Hints:

- parentNode
- Children
- Dataset or “data-“ attribute
